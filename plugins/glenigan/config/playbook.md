**Flag as "maybe" below:** £250,000 — we might still pursue it if the scope is right (total value of the project)

**Investigate regardless of sector above:** £12,000,000 — anything this big is worth a look regardless

**Require explicit scope relevance below:** £250,000 — small projects only qualify if they specifically mention a good fit with our services


## 4. Project Types to Exclude

Relocation of entrance, Shopfront alterations, Fascia replacement, Signage installation, Single room refurb, Door replacement

### 4b. Outdoor / Sports Projects

## 6. Timing

**Minimum lead time:** At least 3 months — if a project starts in under 3 months and doesn't already mention our services, it's probably too late.

**Sweet spot:** 6-12 months before start is ideal — early enough to influence the specification and early enough to make an impact this financial year. The next priority is 12-18 months, because we can influence them early enough and create a pipeline
